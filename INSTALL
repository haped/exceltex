There is a Makefile in which you should edit BIN TEXMF and MANPATH to your
needs and then run 'make install'. The default setting installs the binary
to /usr/local/bin, exceltex.sty to /usr/local/share/texmf/tex/latex/muisc,
and themanpages to /usr/local/man.

Debian users just need to put the following to their sources.list and apt-
get installing it:

deb deb http://www.physik.uni-freiburg.de/~doerr/exceltex/download ./
