** ABOUT

Exceltex allows the transparent inclusion of cells and cell-ranges from MS
Excel files in LaTeX documents.

Exceltex consists of a small LaTeX package and a perl-script. The LaTeX
package  provides  two  simple  commands  for including single cells or
cell-ranges, the perl-script actually extracts the ordered data from the
spread-sheet-file.



** USAGE

Usage of exceltex is quite easy. consider the following LaTeX code:

--- snip ---
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{exceltex}

\begin{document}

\title{a brief introduction to exceltex}
\maketitle

\section{including single cells}

You can include contents of cells by the \\inccell command. Example:
Cell A1 on sheet 'Sheet1' of file foo.xls is: \inccell{foo.xls!Sheet1!A1}

\section{including cell ranges}

this is as easy as including single cells. Look at the following tabular.

\begin{tabular}{lll}
  \hline
  column 1 & colum 2 & colum 3 \\
  \hline
  \inctab{foo.xls!Sheet1!A1!C5}
  \hline
\end{tabular}

\end{document}
--- snap ---

now, run latex, then exceltex, and then latex again.

nifty, isn't it? :-)


** HOW IT WORKS

During the first run of latex, the \inccell and \inctab commands are writing
the ordered cell targes to an index file. This file is then beeing read by the
exceltex command, which extracts the ordered cells and writes them to separate
files. Cell ranges are written to one file, separated by an ampersand (&), as
latex requires it for tabulars.

On the second latex run, the \inccell and \inctab commands then simply are
including these files via tex' \input command.



** INSTALLATION

There is a Makefile in which you should edit BIN TEXMF and MANPATH to your
needs and then run 'make install'. The default setting installs the binary
to /usr/local/bin, exceltex.sty to /usr/local/share/texmf/tex/latex/misc,
and the manpages to /usr/local/man.

Debian users just need to put the following to their sources.list and apt-
get installing it:

deb deb http://www.physik.uni-freiburg.de/~doerr/debian/ ./
