There is a Makefile in which you should edit BIN TEXMF and MANPATH to your
needs and then run 'make install'. The default setting installs the binary
to /usr/local/bin, exceltex.sty to /usr/local/share/texmf/tex/latex/misc,
and the manpages to /usr/local/man.

Debian users just add the following repository to their apt.sources
and do a apt-get install exceltex.

For manual installation, just copy exceltex somewhere in your binary search
path (eg. /usr/local/bin, $HOME/bin) and exceltex.sty somewhere in your
LaTeX package search path (eg. /usr/local/share/texmf/tex/latex/misc, $HOME/texmf/tex/latex/misc).
